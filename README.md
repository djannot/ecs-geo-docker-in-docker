# Description

This repository provides the necessary files to run 2 singlenode ECS clusters in a single Docker container.

It has been tested with ECS 2.0 GA.

This gives anyone the ability to try the ECS Geo capabilities.

You'll need a host with 64 GB of RAM to run this ECS multinode cluster.

*Disclaimer: Don't use this for production.*

# Build

To build the docker images, you just need to run the following command:

```
docker build .
```

This will create a Docker container using the jpetazzo/dind Docker image.

This container will contain all the other files.

# Run

Run the following command to start a container using the image you've just built:

```
./start.sh <image ID>
```

Don't use Ctrl+C because it would kill the Docker service.

You can exit detach the container and use Docker exec to start another bash if you want to avoid this issue.

Run the following command to start the 4 ECS Docker containers inside this Docker container:

```
./run.sh
```

You can then go to /var/log/ecs to see the ECS logs of each node.

If you see in the vnest.log that the different nodes aren't communicating together, it could be because Docker is not using the 10.0.0.0 network. In this case, you can modify the seeds and network.json.* files and rebuild the Docker image.

After approximately 15 minutes, you should be able to access the ECS UI of the first cluster at https://<host> and the UI of the second one at https://<host>:2443.

You can use the license.xml file in this repository and configure your ECS cluster.

The Storage Pool creation can take some times.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the docker pull phase, you probably have to add SSL certificates.

All the .crt files included in the root directory will be added in the Docker image when you build it. If you have .pem files, modify the extension to be .crt.
